# A/B Test 

# What does an A/B test do?
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a marketing experiment wherein you split your audience to test a number of variations of a campaign and determine which performs better. In other words, you can show version A of a piece of marketing content to one half of your audience, and version B to another

# Business Problem 01 (James)
Electronic House is online commerce (e-commerce) of computer products for homes and offices. Customers can buy mice, monitors, keyboards, computers, laptops, HDMI cables, headphones, and webcam cameras, among others, through an online site and receive the products in the comfort of their homes.
The UX designers team has been working on a new sales page, with the objective of increasing the conversion rate of a store product, a bluetooth keyboard. The product manager said that the conversion rate of the current page is 13% on average over the last year.
The product manager's goal is to increase the conversion rate by 2%, that is, the new sales page, developed by the UX team, would be a success if your conversion rate was 15%.
The bluetooth keyboard has a sale price of R$ 4,500.00 in cash or in installments at 12% interest-free on your credit card.
Before exchanging the old sales page for the new one, the product manager would like to test the effectiveness of the new page on a smaller group of customers in order to run less risk of falling conversion if the new page shows a worse conversion than the current page.

## Challenge
Validate the effectiveness of the new page more securely,
with greater security and rigidity in the analysis.
The final results of the work are as follows:
1. Converting a new page is actually better than converting a page
current?
2. What is the potential number of sales that the new page can bring?
3. What is the total revenue from the sale of the bluetooth keyboard through the new page?
